# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

## **Sprint 8 - Vue III**

The third part of my Vue learning journey. This sprint's objective is to practice the usage of components, services and routing, as well as API consumption. I will also learn about Vuex.

The project consists in building a website that shows information about the starships in Star Wars, for which I will have to use [swapi.](https://swapi.dev/)

### ⭐ **Level 1** ⭐

**— Exercise 1**

- Make an API call to swapi and gather an array of starships. This array is rendered as a list, showing the name and model of each starship.

**✏️ Notes**:

- I used Axios to make the API call. Axios makes it even easier to consume APIs since it automatically transforms the data received to JSON.
- I stored the logic for the API call in a separate service file, `StarWarsService.js`. I learned this from [this video by GOGODEV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTRICbkGHoU&list=PLDllzmccetSNgykILXnHMeuO-y-gRcF-i&index=9), although he wrote a class while I decided to go for a functional approach. It's good practice to keep the presentation layer (components, views) and data access layer (APIs, databases) separate!
